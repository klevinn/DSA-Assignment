## Nanyang Polytechnic Y2 DSA Project
This project requires me to implement data structures & algorithms learnt in class and from external sources into a practical setting

**Project Description:**

>Y2 of Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics in NYP consists of the module Data Structures & Algorithm, where we learn how to create Data Structures & Algorithms using Python Programming and how to apply it
>
>This project consists of us creating a Hotel Records System using Python, where the admin gets to sort, search, list and update records stored

## Requirements
1. Display all records

2. Sort record by Customer Name using Bubble sort

3. Sort record by Package Name using Selection sort

4. Sort record by Package Cost using Insertion sort

5. Search record by Customer Name using Linear Search and update record

6. Search record by Package Name using Binary Search and update record

7. List records range from $X to $Y. e.g $100-200

8. Error handling is required.

9. User friendly interface and design
